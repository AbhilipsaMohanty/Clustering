# Clustering
### Clustering Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN
This repository provides an in-depth exploration of various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. The project offers hands-on experience in applying these techniques to a real-world dataset, with a focus on preprocessing, implementation, visualization, and evaluation.

### Objective
The main objective of this assignment is to introduce and apply different clustering algorithms—K-Means, hierarchical, and DBSCAN—to a real-world dataset. This involves preprocessing the data, implementing the clustering algorithms, analyzing the resulting clusters, and evaluating their performance.

### Dataset and Preprocessing
1. Missing Values Handling: Techniques to impute or remove missing data.
2. Outlier Removal: Identifying and treating outliers to improve clustering accuracy.
3. Feature Scaling: Scaling features to ensure uniformity across data points.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Distribution Analysis: Understanding the data distribution to identify potential clusters.
2. Pattern Recognition: Using visualizations to uncover hidden patterns in the dataset.
### Implementing Clustering Algorithms
1. K-Means Clustering:
Implementation using the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
Application of the K-Means algorithm to the preprocessed dataset.
2. Hierarchical Clustering:
Experimentation with different linkage criteria (e.g., single, complete, average) to observe clustering behavior.
Application of hierarchical clustering to the dataset.
3. DBSCAN:
Testing various parameter settings (e.g., epsilon, minPts) to identify clusters.
Application of the DBSCAN algorithm to the dataset.
### Cluster Analysis and Interpretation
1. K-Means Clusters:
Analysis of clusters formed and their characteristics.
2. Hierarchical Clusters:
Interpretation of dendrograms and cluster separations.
3. DBSCAN Clusters:
Identification of noise points and interpretation of cluster shapes.
4. Insights:
Comments on the nature and characteristics of the identified clusters.
### Visualization
1. Cluster Visualization:
Scatter plots to visualize the separation of data points across different clusters.
Use of color-coding to differentiate clusters for clear interpretation.
2. Advanced Visualization Techniques:
Additional plots to enhance understanding of clustering results (e.g., dendrograms for hierarchical clustering).
### Evaluation and Performance Metrics
1. Silhouette Score:
Evaluation of cluster quality for K-Means and DBSCAN using the silhouette score.
2. Cluster Evaluation:
Comparison of clustering results across different algorithms to determine the most effective approach for the given dataset.
